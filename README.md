## Effects of temperature and pH on bacterial growth

In this study, the effects of incubation pH and temperature on the growth of a bacterium with potential use in biotechnology are evaluated. Both enzyme production and the production of industrially interesting metabolites rely on the bacterium's ability to grow in substrates and develop sufficient active biomass.

Temperature and pH are identified as significant environmental factors that influence bacterial growth. The pH of the environment has implications for the stability and activity of enzymes and other cellular components. Bacteria typically have an optimal pH range within which they can thrive and function effectively. Deviating from this range, either towards acidic or basic conditions, can cause denaturation of enzymes and disruption of cellular structure, resulting in hindered or inhibited growth.

Likewise, optimal growth temperature varies across bacterial species. Temperatures below or above the optimal range can lead to decreased enzyme activity and potential denaturation, thus slowing down or inhibiting bacterial growth. Furthermore, temperature affects the fluidity of cellular membranes, which in turn affects the cell's functional capabilities. Consequently, both pH and temperature can impact essential cellular processes necessary for bacterial growth, including enzyme activity and nutrient availability, by modifying the stability and activity of cellular components.

The data used in this manuscript was partially obtained from my thesis to attain my Bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences from the National University of the South. However, it is important to note that the dataset utilized in this study is not identical to the data presented in the thesis, ensuring there is no possibility of copyright infringement.
